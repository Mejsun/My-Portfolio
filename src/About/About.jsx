      <p>
      I am a self-taught junior Front-End developer.
      I love problem solving, researching, and using my creativity to build web applications. 
      I strive to work with attention to detail in mind.
      I have many transferable skills working independently and as part of a team, and have a motivated, 
      self-reliant attitude towards work.
